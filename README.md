# Library Management System
I have created a Library Management System (LMS) written in Java which developed my Java and Object Oriented Programming skills. The program has 20 circles that move around of a screen of a dimension of 1900px by 950px, or designed for an aspect ratio of 16:9. The balls have different colors, move around independently and have been positioned at different areas of the canvas randomly.

This project solified my knowledge of:

The JavaScript syntax.
Immediately Invoked Function Expression (which I researched due to my project but not implemented in my program).
Classes, functions, properties, object literals, constructors.
Basic principles of WebGL.
For loops and if statements.
Feel free to use and implement the program.
