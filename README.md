# Library Management System
I have designed and created a Library Management System (LMS) which is written in Java. This project has drastically developed my Java, Object Oriented Programming and my Software Development Life knowledge. 

The program holds information about books and DVDs stored in a mutable Arraylist. Functionalities such as adding, deleing, borrowing and returning an item (book or DVD) can be done on the application as well as printing a list of items and displaying to the user a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This has been a fun project and it has heavily improved my problem soling skills.



Above is a screenshot of an overview of the functionalities capable of doing on the application.

This project solified my knowledge of:

Design Digrams. E.g UML and Use Case diagrams
Object Oriented Programming prinicples and concepts
The best coding practices
Java Swing

Feel free to use and implement my program.
